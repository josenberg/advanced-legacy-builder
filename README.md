# advanced-legacy-builder

This, in the future will be your legacy builder;

The main reason for building the project is that jekyll is to bloated, hugo is weird and none of them are in Lisp;

## Installation

There is nothing to install yet.

## Usage

The dream will be running this as a script and having my website builded on the end; luckily without any mistakes. 

## License

Copyright? Nah; More like GNU GPLv3 just do not compile and sell this stuff.
